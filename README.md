Configuration notes:

1. `source my.bashrc` in *.bashrc*.
2. `$include my.inputrc` in *.inputrc*.
3. Put *conda.bashrc* in home directory as *my.bashrc* loads it from there.
4. Put the contents of *config* directory in *~/.config* directory of the system.
5. Put *clear_trash* in */etc/cron.daily* directory to automatically delete files older than 30 days from the trash daily.
